# NoSQL eBook

This document is a collection of reports as a partial exam of the course "NoSQL" at the Cooperative State University Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg Stuttgart.

## Getting Started

First you need to install a local latex environment (e.g. [TeX Live Full](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)). You might also have to install [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).

To build the document, run `make` in the root directory of this repository. This will create a `out/latex` directory with the compiled document (`dokumentation.pdf`). Alternatively, it will be automatically build by `latex-workshop`.

## Contributing

> :warning: You **never** contribute to this repository **directly**! Push access to all branches is disabled and all changes need to be done via a pull request.

1. Fork this repository
2. Search your chapter inside the `content` directory (e.g. `content/05kapitel.tex` for **neo4j**)
3. Add your content
   - To cite a source, you need to add it to the `bibliography.bib` file
   - For images, you need to add them to the `images` directory

4. Create a pull request

### Citations

If you want to cite a source at the end of a sentence you can use the following command:

```latex
\parencite{key}
```

If you want to cite a source in the middle of a sentence you can use the following command:

```latex
\textcite{key}
```

Hazelcast is a distributed In-Memory Data Grid platform, developed for Java. It was created by a company of the same name,

After its founding in 2008, the company first released an open-source version of Hazelcast in 2009 and has since been updating it 
continously. \cite{DatabaseofDatabases.11032023} Since this first version, Hazelcast has been used by many well known companies, 
among them Intel and IBM, the former of which collaborates with Hazelcast on the optimization of in-memory computing solution, while
